# Getting Started with the Stock Tokenization Project

**Note**: This is a sample front to support some basic mechanisms and interactions with MetaMask and Truffle & Ganache based smart contract implementation, the StockFactory ERC-1155 compliant, upgradable & ownable contract.

## Description

This project uses the [name generator](https://gist.github.com/tkon99/4c98af713acc73bed74c).

### Connections & interfaces

As mentioned before, the front interacts with:

- MetaMask.
- Ganache & the deployed StockFactory contract.

## How-to

**Note**: The test setup uses the MetaMask integration from a test account of Ganache. In order to simulate the exact same behaviour, please conenct Metamask to your local Ganache cluster.

    git clone
    npm i
    npm start

#### Sidenote

**Sidenote** : _Don't worry if the app is gray. That means a failed MetaMask connection._
